# Computational Astrophysics Project ðŸŒŒ

This project simulates an **N-body system with 50,000 stars**, exploring different evolution algorithms. I compared the **performance of direct force calculations** against a more efficient **tree-code method** and further optimized the computations using **parallel processing**.

Additionally, I computed the **Hernquist profile** and compared the results with theoretical predictions.

## Notebooks ðŸ““
- **Notebook**: [`N_body_project_fixed.ipynb`](N_body_project_fixed.ipynb) â€“ Contains the full implementation, simulations, and analysis.
